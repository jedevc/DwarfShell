# DwarfShell

DwarfShell is a simple, one-file, no-dependency shell that runs on any linux
system with python.

## Downloading

As DwarfShell is just one file, downloading it is very easy.  You can do so in
two ways, using a file downloader such as wget, or using git clone. Either of
these are good, however, using git will allow you to more easily access
upstream changes.

Using wget:

	wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedevc/DwarfShell/master/dwsh.py

Using git clone:

	git clone https://github.com/jedevc/DwarfShell.git
	cd DwarfShell

## Running

Running DwarfShell is just as easy as downloading it, just execute `dwsh.py`.

	./dwsh.py

You can also manually invoke the python interpreter if you want.

	python dwsh.py

## Installation

If for some reason you want to install DwarfShell, then just copy `dwsh.py` to
a directory in your path.

## License

DwarfShell uses the Unlicense and so is completely free and released into the
public domain. Do whatever you feel like doing with it, although some
attribution might be nice :)
