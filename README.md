# DwarfShell

DwarfShell is a simple, one-file, no-dependency shell that runs on any linux
system with python.

## Downloading

As DwarfShell is just one file, downloading it is very easy.  You can do so in
two ways, using a file downloader such as wget, or using git clone. Either of
these are good, however, using git will allow you to more easily access
upstream changes.

Using wget:

	wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedevc/DwarfShell/master/dfsh.py

Using git clone:

	git clone https://github.com/jedevc/DwarfShell.git
	cd DwarfShell

## Running

Running DwarfShell is just as easy as downloading it, just execute `dfsh.py`
using python. Make sure you're using python3.

	python dfsh.py
